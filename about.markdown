My name is Bryan Relampagos, and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Infor Nexus working on Supply Chain Visibility. In May 2016, I
graduated Cum Laude from the University of San Francisco with a
Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.

I enjoy tackling difficult challenges, and finding elegant
solutions for them. I believe the beauty of software development
is that it requires one to think with both logic and creativity. I
enjoy creating things, and am always interested in collaborating
with others. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact
me at barelampagos@gmail.com, or message me directly.
