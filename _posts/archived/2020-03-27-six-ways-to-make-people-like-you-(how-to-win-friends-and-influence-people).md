title: 'Six Ways to Make People Like You (How To Win Friends and Influence People)'
---

Here's part 2 of my takeaways from the book 'How To Win Friends and Influence People' by Dale Carnegie. So far, a lot of these tips to me are "common sense" (in a 'well duh that makes sense' kind of way). Hopefully me reiterating these will help instill these tips into my daily life.

## Part 2: SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU

# Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people

- You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
- "It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others." - Alfred Adler
- If we want to make friends, let's put ourselves out to do things for other people -- things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.
- Let's greet others with animation and enthusiasm.
- A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere.

# Principle 2: Smile

- Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you."
- An insincere grin doesn't fool anyone - we know it is mechanical and we resent it.
- You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.
- Don't feel like smiling? Try to act as if you were already happy, and it will tend to make you happy.
- "Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not" - William James, philosopher
- It isn't what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.
- "...greet your friends with a smile... do not fear being misunderstood, and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies... we become like that on which are our hearts are fixed." - Elbert Hubbard, essayist and publisher

# Principle 3: Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

- Remember one's name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it -- and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
- One of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and making people feel important.

# Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.

- Listen intently, listen because you are genuinely interested. Others will feel it.
- Others want a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom they can unburden themself. That's what we all want when we are in trouble.
- Be attentive, be interested, and ask questions the other person will enjoy answering. Encourage others to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.

# Principle 5: Talk in terms of the other person's interests

- The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things they treasure most.

# Principle 6: Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.

- Always make the other person feel important.
- Obey the golden rule, and give unto others what we would have others give unto us.
- "...almost all people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely"
