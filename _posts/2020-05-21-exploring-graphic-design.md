title: 'Exploring Graphic Design'
---

After doing a bit of work with After Effects, I wanted to give graphic design a shot. I've always had a passing interest in Graphic Design, and in hindsight, wish I pursued a Design minor back in University.

However, that doesn't mean there isn't learning opportunities online - and so here are some of the designs I've come up with lately:

## Textured Abstract

This piece came about as a result of a Skillshare class from Tom Appleton, and was the first time I ever really got to explore some of the hidden functionality of Photoshop.

I used this image as the starting point for the composition:

## Phoenix

Using the same techniques from the previous composition, I attempted to create a phoenix. This piece was inspired by the uprising of Protesters at the response of the George Floyd incident.

## Taito Station

This image was used for some Spotify playlist art, and came about during some experimentation with using Adobe Illustrator to vectorize some photos.

## DJ ED Logo

This was a quick logo generated for my friend Edwin, who had recently taken up DJing as a hobby. This logo was based on a logo from Ozark, and was my first attempt at building an image from scratch using Illustrator.
