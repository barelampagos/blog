title: '2021 - March & April: Eating healthy + Being active'
---

March and April goals were similar, so I tried to incorporate both of these for these two months. The inspiration for these came about as a part of the quarantine life. Due to shelter in place & WFH, my daily routine was basically me just changing which chair and which screen I was in front of at different parts of the day. I'd become so used to just working at my desk all day, having dinner, then sitting in front of the TV for the rest of the night. My body definitely feeling the COVID weight :P On top of that, eating out has become less of an exciting activity, and more of a daily occurrance.

To help with these, I've tried to incorporate doing Alo Moves virtual fitness classes (shoutout Christine for her subscription!) a couple times a week. Initially, I would hop into these classes cold, without stretching or warming up. Because of that I would usually find myself terribly sore the next day, so I've come to realize the importance of stretching.

Eating healthier was also a challenge, especially since it's a lot easier just to hop on Doordash and just grab whatever. Christine and I tried to make it a point to go grocery shopping for things to eat during the week, and aim for healthier choices. Not going too deep with counting calories or anything, just opting for healthier choices and smaller portions wherever possible.

Moving forward into May, I'll be trying to do a better job at actually tracking certain habits to have a tangible idea of how much/little I've worked on the monthly goal. So far though, I feel like the little monthly challenges have helped me build up some habits that I'd like to carry with me in life. 4 months in have been fun, and I feel like these have helped with the stagnation of the WFH life. As things continue to get better in the world (vaccinations) and we move back into the pre-covid "normal life" again, I hope to continue to build positive habits.
