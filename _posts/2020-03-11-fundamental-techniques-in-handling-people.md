title: 'Fundamental Techniques in Handling People'
---

Last week (3/5) was the kickoff meeting for the BVA (Bronco Accelerator Program) that I'll be participating in with my team Kevin, Ryan, and Patrick (Team OOS!). Our first homework assignment was to read the famous "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. While I have not fully finished reading all of this book yet, I at least wanted to document my takeaways from the first section of this book, titled "Fundamental Techniques in Handling People". This post will consist of a collection of notes, paraphrased content, and direct quotes from the book. I truly believe these ideas are gold, and worth sharing.

As I continue on reading through this book, I'll continue to update with additional posts that make up later sections.

# Part 1: FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE

## Principle 1: Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.

- People don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.
- Criticism is futile; it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify them self.
- By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.
- The person we correct/condemn will probably justify them self, and condemn us in return.
- Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do. It takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

## Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.

- The deepest urge in human nature is "the desire to be important".
- The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.
- "If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise" - Charles Schwab
- "... we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of morning stars" - D.C.
- Flattery will do you more harm than good.
  - Appreciation: Sincere, from the heart, unselfish, universally admired
  - Flattery: Insincere, teeth out, selfish, universally condemned
  - "Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."
- Figure out a person's good points, forget flattery, and give honest, sincere appreciation.

## Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.

- "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own" - Henry Ford
- If salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won't need to sell us. We'll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying - not being sold.
- Try to think always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle.
- Looking at one's POV and arousing an eager want for something is NOT to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment.
  - Each party should gain from the negotiation.
- "First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has thewhole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way" - Harry A. Overstreet
