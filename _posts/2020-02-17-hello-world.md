Hi everyone, my name is Bryan Relampagos, and I am a Software Developer located in the Bay Area.

This blog is intended to be somewhat of a learning journal for myself. I've wanted some place to display the things that I've created, as well as an outlet to reflect upon the challenges + knowledge I've encountered during the process.

My interests include software/web development, photography, videography, and cooking - so you can expect future posts to be related to my journey in developing these skills.

Thanks for stopping by!
