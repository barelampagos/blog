title: 'Quarantine Learning: After Effects'
---

It's been a little over a month now stuck in quarantine, and with the amount of free time stuck at home, I've started to take up learning how to make motion graphics in Adobe's After Effects.

It's crazy how much online learning resources are available these days. I've found solid lessons from Youtube, Skillshare, and Udemy. There's so much power I have yet to uncover from using After Effects, and still, I'm able to create pretty interesting graphics.

Here's a collection of the animations I've made so far:

I eventually want to work towards making animations that synchronize with some of my favorite music, but I still have a bit of ways to go! :)
