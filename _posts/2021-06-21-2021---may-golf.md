title: '2021 - May: Golf'
---

May's goal came about randomly through an invitation to Top Golf with some of my friends. To avoid making a fool of myself, I called upon the best golfer I know, my dad. I've spent a lot of May learning basic form and technique for my golf swing from my dad through various trips to the golf range. I've come to realize that there's a lot of mental game and muscle memory, both of which people spend many years honing.

My dad trained my brother and I through a variety of scenarios, like basic driving, short game and chipping, and targetting certain distances. All of our training lead to my first 18 round on June 5th, where I was able to put all the training to the test.

This round taught me a lot about where the holes are in my game + swing, but overall I had a great time. On top of being a fun sport to hone and practice, I'm grateful to have something to share with my dad and my brother. Looking forward to continuing to practice, and to up my game & technique.
