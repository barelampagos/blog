When I need a break from software, I like to do photography and graphic design. I've been working on simple / random designs here and there, and always like to capture some shots each time I vacation anywhere.

## Application Login Photo

Recently, my company (Infor Nexus) hosted a small contest for photos to be selected for the application login page, and a few of mine made it through! Here's a few shots of that now:

![Japan Background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/japan_infor_bg.jpg)

![New York Background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ny_infor_bg.jpg)

![NYC Background]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyc_infor_bg.jpg)

Feels great to be able to leave my mark on our application in a creative way. üòÅ

## Design Work for DJ FTWED

Lately, I've been doing more graphic work for my buddy DJ FTWED, here's some of those designs in action:

For his profile, I've designed a Twitch Banner featuring his Jolli-ED and Circle Logo.

![Starting Soon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/starting-soon.png)

For his stream, I've designed a 'FTWED RADIO' screen, and together we've setup the visualizer to listen to his audio output. [Go check him out](https://www.twitch.tv/dj_ftwed)!
